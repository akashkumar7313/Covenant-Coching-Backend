                    Covenant Education of Languages was founded in 2005 by Hugo  <br />
                    and Lessandra Alves. Together, their years of language learning  <br />
                    and teaching experience have helped propel a small Spanish-only <br />
                    school into 2 locations offering 7 language options today.

                    Collectively, Covenant Education’s directors have earned 2 CELTAs, <br />
                    2 Masters Degrees, 1 DELE and 1 DELTA. They’ve reached fluency in <br />
                    9 languages, and taught over 1,500 students from 36 countries <br /> combining  
                    their considerable expertise with years of experience  <br /> in learning
                    environments around the world.

                    Their dream is for Covenant Education to serve as a bridge
                    that  <br /> connects India and the world by providing
                    culturally relevant and  <br /> innovative language learning,
                    equipping students to communicate  <br /> confidently and
                    succeed in their individual goals.
